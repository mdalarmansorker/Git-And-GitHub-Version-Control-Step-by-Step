# Git and GitHub: Version Control Step-by-Step

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a web-based platform used for version control and collaborative development of projects. It uses Git, an open-source version control system, to track changes in the code. GitHub provides a central repository where developers can store and manage their code, track issues, review code, and collaborate with other developers.

## What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. It allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without interfering with each other's changes. Git tracks changes, allows for branching and merging, and provides a history of all changes made to the codebase.

## Differences Between Git, GitHub, and Google Drive

| Feature/Functionality | Git                          | GitHub                        | Google Drive                    |
|-----------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Type**              | Version Control System       | Hosting service for Git repositories | Cloud Storage Service           |
| **Collaboration**     | Yes, through branching/merging | Yes, with additional features for collaboration and project management | Yes, but primarily for document sharing and collaboration |
| **Version Tracking**  | Yes                          | Yes                           | Limited                         |
| **Local Repository**  | Yes                          | No, but works with local Git repositories | No                              |
| **Code Review**       | No                           | Yes                           | No                              |

## Installing Git Bash

### On Windows

1. Download Git for Windows from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
2. Run the downloaded installer.
3. Follow the instructions in the setup wizard. It is recommended to use the default settings.

### On Mac

1. Open Terminal.
2. Install Homebrew if not already installed:
   ```sh
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
3. Install Git using Homebrew:
   ```sh
   brew install git
   ```
### On Linux
1. Open Terminal
2. Update the package list:
   ```sh
   sudo apt update
   ```
3. Install Git:
   ```sh
   sudo apt install git
   ```
### Setting Up Git After Installation
1. Open Git Bash (Windows) or Terminal (Mac/Linux).
2. Configure your Git username:
   ```sh
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   ```
3. Configure your Git Email:
   ```sh
   git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
   ```

### Using Git and GitHub
## Basic Git Commands
1. Initialize a Repository in your local machine:
   ```sh
   git init
   ```
2. Create a repository on GitHub and copy the link of the repository then add this to the local repository of your machine:
   ```sh
   git add origin https::github.com/your_github_user_name/your_repository_name
   ```
3. Check changes:
   ```sh
   git status
   ```
4. Moved untracked file to tracked file:
   1. Add a specific file
      ```sh
      git add "file name"
      ```
   2. Add all files:
      ```sh
      git add .
      ```
5. Moved tracked file to stage by commit or saved in local repository:
   ```sh
   git commit -m "comments"
   ```
6. Push the committed file to GitHub repository:
   ```sh
   git push -u origin branch_name
   ```
   No need to use "-u origin branch_name" if you are pushing into an existing branch of GitHub and it is the present branch of the local machine. But you need to use it when you want to push another branch.
7. Create a new branch:
   ```sh
   git checkout -b branch_name
   ```
8. Go to the existing branch
   ```sh
   git checkout branch_name
   ```
9. Clone the repository on local
   ```sh
   git clone repository_link
   ```
10. To pull something from branch:
    ```sh
    git pull origin branch_name
    ```
    No need to use "origin branch_name" if you are pulling from present branch.
